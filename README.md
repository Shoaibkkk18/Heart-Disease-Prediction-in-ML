# Heart-Disease-Prediction-in-ML
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Python Machine Learning in Google Colab
Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various health-related parameters that are used to train models for classification. The project is implemented in Python using Google Colab.

Features
